# WorldLogic

**Welcome to the stash of stuff I made for my maps, everything is written in [Mindcode](https://github.com/cardillan/mindcode). Please don't use any of this logic without permission.**


**Multiplayer Compatibility:** Everything that is important in the game control is synced properly. Visual Effects aren't synced when they don't matter.

**PVP Compatibility:** Implemented where it's easy, not tested, I will get around to it some day.

## Mixtech Overhaul

Reworks the following Erekir blocks with new functionalities:

- **Impact and Eruption Drills:**  
  Sidegrades to Laser and Airblast Drills, with the added chance to mine different byproducts depending on the ore.

- **Vents and Vent Condensers:**  
  All vents are assigned a procedurally generated resource, which can be extracted using vent condensers.

- **Flux Reactor, Pyrolysis Generator, and Chemical Combustion Chamber:**  
  These three blocks are integrated into a recreation of the Forge from Creeper World 3, enabling upgrades to various stats.

The main objective of these reworks is to give previously underused blocks a reason to exist in a Mixtech environment. For example, the Impact and Eruption Drills are generally considered inferior to Serpulo drills in vanilla, so these changes provide them with new value.

These reworks are designed with the following ore progression:

- **Tier 1:** Copper / Lead / Coal / Scrap / Sand  
  (Sand can be placed in any tier if Scrap is present)
- **Tier 2:** Beryllium / Titanium
- **Tier 3:** Thorium  
  _(Important: Phase Weaver is banned, placing Phase tech after Tungsten)_
- **Tier 4:** Tungsten

**Notable banned blocks** due to balance concerns include the previously mentioned Phase Weaver, Arc Furnace, and Cliff Crusher. Additionally, most redundant blocks such as Erekir conduits and Erekir beam nodes are also banned to reduce block clutter.
